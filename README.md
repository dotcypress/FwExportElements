Fireworks export elements extension
=====

This is the .zip version of a Fireworks extension.  It's generally better to use the Extension Manager application to install the .mxp version instead, since that will automatically put the files where they're supposed to go.  But the .zip is provided in case the Extension Manager fails for some reason.

To install these files manually, you must unzip the archive while preserving file paths.  If you don't see any folders next to this readme and just a bunch of files, then the file paths were lost when the archive was unzipped.  Try unzipping the archive with different options.

Once the files are extracted, you can install them by moving the folders from the archive to "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Fireworks CS4\Configuration" (on Windows) and merging the contents with any existing folders (don't *replace* the existing folders, as you'll lose all your existing commands!).

If you see folders named "win" or "mac", then there are also some platform-specific files that need to be copied.  Pick whichever folder corresponds to your operating system, and then copy its contents to the "Configuration" folder.

For instance, if you downloaded the "Greeked Text" extension, you'll see two folders in the archive, named "Commands" and "Auto Shapes".  Move those folders to the Fireworks "Configuration" folder.  In this example, you should end up with two new files in "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Fireworks CS4\Configuration\Auto Shapes" and a new folder called "Greeked Text" in "C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Fireworks CS4\Configuration\Commands".
